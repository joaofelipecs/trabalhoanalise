Long duration dialogues are conversations and audio content ranging from 5 seconds to several hours. Yap specializes in accurately transcribing these dialogues for a variety of different scenarios including voicemail-to-text, conference call transcriptions, analysis of customer phone calls and voice-activated mobile messaging.The company was a TechCrunch finalist in 2007. Their management team previously worked on Apple's iPod, Honda's navigational systems, IBM's ViaVoice, Microsoft's Tellme speech division and Nuance's Dragon products.Yap white labels its SaaS platform -- i.e., Yap Speech CloudTM -- to enable diverse use cases, including messaging, call analytics and voicemail-to-text. For example, Microsoft uses Yap for voice-based mobile messaging applications. Their end users can say anything they want to and have Yap's platform transcribe it into text far more convenient than typing on the fumbling with a devices keypad while driving. MetroPCS also is a Yap customer. Cincinnati Bell, a regional carrier, uses Yap-based technology to convert subscriber voicemails into text. The carrier was a competitive win away from SpinVox now Nuance. Part of the allure for Yap's service is that it's completely automated. That means there is no need for humans listening to messages, typing them out, and then sending them back out, giving Yap a real advantage in ensuring privacy.

NeXT was founded in 1985 by Apple Computer co-founder Steve Jobs after his forced resignation from Apple. NeXT introduced the first NeXT Computer in 1988, and the smaller NeXTstation in 1990. Sales of the NeXT computers were relatively limited, with estimates of about 50,000 units shipped in total. Nevertheless, its innovative object-oriented NeXTSTEP operating system and development environment were highly influential.NeXT later released much of the NeXTSTEP system as a programming environment standard called OpenStep. NeXT withdrew from the hardware business in 1993 to concentrate on marketing OPENSTEP, its own OpenStep implementation, for several OEMs. NeXT also developed WebObjects, one of the first enterprise web application frameworks. WebObjects never became very popular because of its initial high price of $50,000 but remains a prominent early example of a web server based on dynamic page generation rather than static content. Apple purchased NeXT on December 20, 1996 for $429 million, and much of the current Mac OS X system is built on the OPENSTEP foundation. WebObjects is now bundled with Mac OS X Server and Xcode.",http://next.com,,Apple,Apple acquired NeXT in 1996,http://api.crunchbase.com/v/2/organization/next?user_key=0ebdc8274e821149894a240090945265

A pioneer in its industry, Autonomy's unique meaning-based technology is able to make sense of and process unstructured, 'human information,' and draw real business value from that meaning.Human information makes up the vast majority of content in the world today and exists almost everywhere: in documents, emails, pictures, audio, video, and mobile and social media communications. Unlike tagging or keyword solutions, Autonomy uses ground-breaking, pattern-matching technology to form an understanding of this data, allowing computers to capture the meaning held within 100 percent of information, including structured, 'extreme,' or 'big data' amassed in databases from call detail records, gene sequencing, sensors, algorithmic trading, click streams, and other sources. Autonomy software helps businesses and organizations reduce complexity and unlock the real value in data.Autonomy provides meaning-based solutions that understand the full spectrum of enterprise information as well as the relationships that exist within it. By enabling computers to comprehend the 'shades of grey' in our world, rather than only the black and white found in databases, businesses can automate processes, comply with regulations, act in real time, and improve business outcomes.Understanding 100% of InformationThe characteristic that makes human information unstructured is its form - it does not fit neatly into the rows and columns of a database, but exists in various formats including books, email messages, surveillance video, chat streams, and phone calls that occur across networks, the web, the cloud, and numerous mobile devices. Growing at a rate three times that of structured data, the increasing deluge of unstructured information makes up approximately 90 percent of all information. The challenge for the modern enterprise is to understand and extract value from this rich sea of human information.Today, with Autonomy, organizations can now process and understand in real time, the meaning of 100 percent of information.

A sports team Tabblo could be customized by each parent, for example, to easily put their child's picture in the center of the poster but maintain the same design as the whole team's posters.

However, unlike the other two, earthmine uses a stereoscopic system with wide angle lenses that allow them to capture fully spherical images of the surrounding environment.

Except for the most routine cases, hunting for these insights requires grappling with complex, difficult-to-learn interfaces or tedious programming. Questions about data that take moments to formulate can take hours or much longer to answer.SkyPhrase aims to change this. With SkyPhrase, you can pose a question in simple natural language, and our artificial intelligence technology will figure out what you mean, and how to answer. Our goal is to make it easy to use all data this simply. Our web analytics and football statistics services are early steps towards achieving this goal.At SkyPhrase, our approach to natural language understanding is different because of our goals and because of our technology. We focus on giving people significantly more power over their data in specific areas, and allowing developers to easily add support to other areas. Within these areas, our technology can understand significantly more complex language with greater precision than any other technology. While we currently only cover web analytics and football statistics, our technology makes it extremely simple and easy for developers with little knowledge of linguistics or artificial intelligence to create natural language interfaces to their own data and applications. Our technology has been developed by scientists with decades of experience in artificial intelligence and computational linguistics research at institutions such as MIT, Stanford and Rensselaer. If you have a data set or API you would like to access with natural language, let us know.Stay tuned as we expand SkyPhrase to more areas, make it more powerful and enable third parties to use our technology for their own data and applications.",http://skyphrase.com,http://twitter.com/skyphrase,Yahoo,Yahoo! acquired SkyPhrase in 2013,http://api.crunchbase.com/v/2/organization/skyphrase?user_key=0ebdc8274e821149894a240090945265
